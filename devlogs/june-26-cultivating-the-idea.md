# June 26: The Idea

Hello everyone! Hope you are having a good day. I wish to add more to it by telling you about the new game I'm working on.

It's called Blazeblaze, a top down shooter where you use magic to alter the balance of the world. The are 3 core themes to the game for which I would like to explore in this development. They are Order, Chaos, and "The Middle Way." Allow me to tell you more.

## **The World**

Everything as you know it has been created by the magic of order and chaos. And everything has a mixture of both. The nature of the creations of the world is determined by the balance between the two. An excess of Chaos and the creation is chaotic, dark, powerful, but slow and unpredictable. One born out of Order is light, fast, sturdy, but rigid in their ways. The world itself must have a balance between the two in order to stay healthy and working as it was created.

## Order vs. Chaos

The two oppose each and have been clashing since the beginning of time. They exist together, but never at the same time. 

Where the story starts is during the downfall of this balance, where Chaos for some unknown reason is becoming the prevailing condition of the world. This is why the Crusaders guild was created. They believe that the best way for them to fix this problem **forever** they must bring complete Order to the world so that  Chaos never exists again. A reliable guild, they harness the magic of order to alter the lands so that good may happen and people may be at peace.

As for the growing influence of Chaos, some believe that there are human forces behind this. Others claim it to be the new coming of the God of Chaos. Few think it is the end of the world as we know it. Nobody knows the truth and this leaves everyone in a state of panic. What will happen to the world?

## The Middle Way

This is where the player comes in. A hidden force that dwells within each human allows them to choose freely between Order and Chaos. Those who have a predilection to Order are who are ideal candidates for the Crusaders guild. You play as a manifestation of this force called into being \(for reasons the story will tell\) and help control the balance of the World.

This is where you have 3 choices:

1. You may follow your destiny, bringing balance to the world and spreading the teachings of a lost tradition called "The Middle Way".
2. You may choose to side with the Crusaders who have the noble aim of removing all Chaos from the World.
3. Or, You may help increase Chaos until the world knows of nothing else.

Each choice changes the state of the game and the agents available to you.

## Where To Go From Here

I want to create this story into a game that incorporate dynamic content generation to handle the creation of characters, objectives, and player stats. I hope to give players plenty of choice for how they want to play the game and advance through the story. The themes you just read of will be spread through the game and told through stories, hidden information \(discovered through exploration\), and random events that occur. 

I'm excited to bring this game to you and to have a playable version by July 7th!

Stay tuned for more weekly logs.
